                        Automating <a href="https://www.compsust.net/" target="_blank">sustainability</a> and <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~bultan/courses/272/" target="_blank">software</a> discoveries with computational power
                    </div>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">I am a software engineer by profession and researcher by passion. Before this, I obtained my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.ewubd.edu/" target="_blank">East West University (EWU)</a> and later started working as a software engineer. During my undergraduate, I worked with <a href="https://fse.ewubd.edu/computer-science-engineering/faculty-view/saddam.cse" target="_blank">M Saddam Hossain Khan</a> and <a href="https://fse.ewubd.edu/computer-science-engineering/faculty-view/mmuddin" target="_blank">Md Mohsin Uddin</a>  on Machine Learning and Deep Learning including Transfer Learning. I, along with M Saddam Hossain Khan (supervisor) and Md Mohsin Uddin (co-supervisor), have completed the thesis which is under review by an impact factored international journal. 
                        <br> <br> My research aims toward automated sustainability and software discoveries through Machine Intelligence. Research experience before joining the software industry and working as a software engineer has encouraged me to think curiously like a researcher while working. Many questions still need to be answered in the software industry, from requirement engineering to testing, to improve the software development process. 
                        <br> <br> Recently, I have been greatly moved from inside by a field called computational sustainability. Although, in the past, I was always worried about world sustainability, the recent pandemic, the dramatical climate changes, energy and aid deficiencies, increasing world pollutions and poverty impacted my point of view. I have found my purpose in life in addressing sustainability issues with computational methods like AI and software engineering. Perhaps, since my birth, living in the valleys of sylhet, close to nature, near mountains and rivers, has a great influence in my purpose.
                        <br> <br> "Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know, that doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're going to win. Whatever it takes. Good luck."

                    <p>
                        Apart from my academic and professional life, I enjoy my time being with my family and friends. I love to live a natural life in nature. Though it is not always possible, I do travel a lot around the natural places especially mountains and rivers. During the winter in Sylhet, I enjoy morning walk, biking, and mountain hiking. I love to do workouts regularly. I am really into freehand exercise, yoga, and calisthenics. I believe that truth and nature are the ultimate sources of happiness.

                     <p>Abstract—Due to COVID-19, work from home has become
                        a new norm. Though remote software development subsisted
                        from many years ago where there is the presence of office,
                        work from home software development is growing a new norm
                        from a few years ago. In this research, we designed and
                        conducted a survey to explore the impact of work from home
                        software development on developers and development processes.
                        We identified the motivators and deterrents in the process
                        of work from home software development and observed how
                        work from home software development affecting productivity
                        compared to traditional software development. We collected 11
                        responses for our data from software developers who are serving
                        on different software applications. We found with our data
                        analysis that family is the topmost motivator and salary is the
                        topmost deterrent for most of the developers. Our data analysis
                        shows work from home software development has insignificantly
                        decreased the development productivity, though communication
                        between developers has increased. Our data analysis also shows
                        that development processes have not been affected enormously
                        by work from home software development. The use of the Agile
                        development method has increased in work from home software
                        development compared to traditional software development. Our
                        research leads to the necessity of increasing the motivators,
                        decreasing the deterrents for developers, and investigating and
                        fixing the issues that decrease productivity in work from home
                        software development.

                     <p>Abstract— This paper helps in predicting diabetes by applying machine learning technique. Thus, the most important issue is the prediction to be very accurate and to use a reliable method for that. Three different machine learning algorithms are used in this research work. For experiment purpose, a dataset of patient's medical record is obtained and three different machine learning algorithms are applied on the dataset. Performance and accuracy of the applied algorithms is discussed and compared. Comparison of the different machine learning techniques used in this study reveals which algorithm is best suited for prediction of diabetes. The results show that the machine learning algorithms can able to produce highly accurate diabetes predictive healthcare systems.

                    <p> Introduction- The online classroom is a very popular platform for the education system. Many countries are now enforcing the online classroom system so that the teachers and students can communicate with each other. For example a very common and known to all ‘Google Classroom’. This online classroom system provides many facilities like shared materials, assignments, grade students, create unlimited courses, add students in there, etc. This is a great opportunity for every educational institute to enlarge and ease their education system. After the covid-19 breakdown, most of the educational institutes all around the world went into the online classroom system. They are using many online classroom platforms like ‘TalentLMS’,’ Google Classroom’, ‘visme’, etc. So, we have got the motivation to make this online classroom system for teachers and students. Our Eduhome online classroom system has some similar features like ‘google classroom’ but we have added some different features to it. Also, our classroom had some extra features that can help the teachers to teach their students more efficiently. Our Eduhome online classroom provides some facilities that can be highly mentioned. We have made a whiteboard feature where a teacher can easily draw so that she/he can teach the students more understandably. Also, our system provides an opportunity to see how many students are online in a specific class whenever a teacher creates a class according to the schedule. Also, in the scheduled class, the teacher and students can get a feature where they could start conversations. So, our EduHome online system has some significant facilities that a teacher or a student can utilize for their educational purpose.
